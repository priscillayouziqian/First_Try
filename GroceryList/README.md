## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Involved JavaScript includes DOM manipulation, functions, control structures, event listeners. 
When users click on "Enter", a new item will be added to the end of the current list. 
When users click on specific item, it crosses out.
When users click on the pencil icon, it deletes all the existing items.

## Optimizations
It will be great if we can delete one item at a time, instead of deleting them all. Maybe add an event listener to delete that particular grocery item, add an eraser icon at the beginning of each item that triggers the event listener.

## Lessons Learned:

Make sure to add comments to JavaScript each step. Also, when deleting something, whenever "click" function happens, just add userInput.value equals an empty string.
