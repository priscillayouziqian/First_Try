        <p>Throughout the year, Iceland offers amazing travel experiences, therefore you decide what you would like to experience and on this background choose the right travel time. The best travel season with the most comfortable temperatures and longer days is from May to September. The highland roads are usually open from Mid June to Mid September. The most colorful period of nature is from mid/end of August to early October. By that time and if the nights are clear and cold, you might even be lucky to spot the first Northern lights. But if you rather prefer winterly moments, you should travel between December and March.</p>
