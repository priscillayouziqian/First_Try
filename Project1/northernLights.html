The best travel season with the most comfortable temperatures and longer days is from May to September. The highland roads are usually open from Mid June to Mid September. The most colorful period of nature is from mid/end of August to early October. By that time and if the nights are clear and cold, you might even be lucky to spot the first Northern lights.
